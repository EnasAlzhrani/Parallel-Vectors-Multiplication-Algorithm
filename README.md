# Parallel-Vectors-Multiplication-Algorithm
Abstract. Multiplying vectors sequentially takes a long time, especially when they are large, but reducing the calculation time by splitting the vector and then performing parallel calculations then combining the results is more efficient than sequential calculations and would have a significant impact on the time and performance. In this project, our goal is to create sequential and parallel vector multiplication algorithms, multiply the vectors several times with various sizes, and then compare the average time taken by each algorithm in each size. The algorithms we designed are the Sequential algorithm, OpenMP algorithm, and MPI algorithm. The MPI algorithm was the most efficient and took the least amount of time, followed by OpenMP, and then the Sequential algorithm which was the worst; it took the most amount of time. We conclude that splitting the vectors and performing parallel methods are more efficient and produce better results in terms of time and efficiency than sequential methods.
